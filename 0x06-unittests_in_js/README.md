# 0x06. Unittests in JS

This project covers the fundamentals of unit and integration testing in JavaScript using Node.js. It explores various testing tools and techniques, including:

*   **Mocha:** A feature-rich JavaScript test framework.
*   **Node.js `assert`:** Node's built-in assertion library.
*   **Chai:** A BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser.
*   **Sinon:** A library for spies, stubs, and mocks.
*   **Express.js:** For creating a simple API for integration testing.

## Tasks

The project is divided into several tasks, each building upon the last to introduce new concepts:

*   **0. Basic test with Mocha and Node assertion library:** Introduction to `mocha` and `assert`.
*   **1. Combining descriptions:** Organizing tests with `describe`.
*   **2. Basic test using Chai assertion library:** Using the `chai` assertion library (`expect`).
*   **3. Spies:** Using `sinon` to create spies.
*   **4. Stubs:** Using `sinon` to create stubs.
*   **5. Hooks:** Using `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks in Mocha.
*   **6. Async tests with done:** Testing asynchronous code with the `done` callback.
*   **7. Skip:** Skipping tests using `it.skip`.
*   **8. Basic Integration testing:** Setting up a basic Express API and testing it.
*   **9. Regex integration testing:** Using regex in routes and testing different outcomes.
*   **10. Deep equality & Post integration testing:** Testing JSON responses and POST endpoints.

Each task has its own set of files, including the source code and the corresponding test file.
